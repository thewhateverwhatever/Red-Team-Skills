# Understanding MySQL

## What Is MySQL?

**MySQL** is a type of **relational database management system (RDBMS)** that uses **SQL (Structured Query Language)** to store and work with data.  
Let’s break those terms down:

### **Database**
A database is an organised, long-term storage system for structured data.

### **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**
This is software that creates and manages databases using the **relational model**, where data is stored in **tables**.  
Tables relate to each other through **keys**, such as *primary keys* and *foreign keys*.

### **SQL (Structured Query Language)**
SQL is the language used to communicate with relational databases.  
MySQL uses SQL commands to create tables, insert data, update records, and more.

> MySQL is simply the **brand name** of one of the most widely used SQL-based database systems.  
Other SQL-based systems include **PostgreSQL**, **MariaDB**, and **Microsoft SQL Server**.

## How Does MySQL Work?

MySQL operates using a **client–server model**, and consists of:

- **The MySQL server** → handles requests, processes queries, and manages data  
- **Utility programs / clients** → tools that send SQL commands to the server

Here’s the basic workflow:

1. **MySQL creates a database** to store tables and define how they relate.  
2. **Clients send SQL statements** (commands) to perform actions like selecting, inserting, or updating data.  
3. **The server executes the request**, processes the query, and sends back the result.

The MySQL server is responsible for:

- Creating databases and tables  
- Managing data access  
- Handling queries efficiently  
- Enforcing rules and relationships between tables

## What Runs MySQL?

MySQL is extremely flexible and can run on:

- **Linux**
- **Windows**
- **macOS**
- Many server distributions

It is one of the most popular databases for websites and applications.  
MySQL is also a core part of the well-known **LAMP stack**:

- **L**inux  
- **A**pache  
- **M**ySQL  
- **P**HP/Python/Perl  

This stack powers a large portion of the modern web.

# Enumerating MySQL

1. We first start by enumerating, as we did with the previous privescs, the port MySQL runs on is 3306./


2. Now, we run the user enumeration, the username and password are: root:password


3. We confirm this by running the following command

<img width="724" height="641" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f45d7954-1140-4a73-af31-e3d798caf449" />


4. The following results confirm that the credentials are correct

5. Now we find out the databases on running on the server

This is it for the enumeration part, now we move onto the exploitation part.

# Exploiting MySQL

1. We run this command to extract schema information

<img width="724" height="648" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/527479dc-b792-432f-8ec7-f139a13752a1" />

and the following is the result, we have dumped all of the tables:

2. Now we are gonna extract the usernames and encrypted password hashes from the SQL server

3. Now we crack the password using johntheripper.

4. SSH into the machine with the creds now.

and this is it for the MySQL exploitation.
